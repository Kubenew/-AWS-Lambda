# -AWS-Lambda
CI/CD pipeline for deploying AWS Lambda functions using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CloudFormation
Create a new AWS Lambda function in the AWS Management Console, and write the code for the function.

Create a new AWS CodeCommit repository for your Lambda function. You can use Git or any other version control system.

Create a new AWS CodePipeline pipeline that connects to your CodeCommit repository. The pipeline should be set up to automatically build and deploy your Lambda function whenever changes are made to the repository.

Configure your pipeline to use AWS CodeBuild to build your Lambda function package. Here's an example buildspec.yml file for building a Node.js-based Lambda function:
Configure your pipeline to use AWS CloudFormation to deploy your Lambda function stack. Here's an example deployment step for CloudFormation:
Set up automated tests to ensure that your Lambda function is functioning correctly after deployment. You can use tools such as AWS Lambda Test Events to simulate Lambda function invocations, and tools such as AWS X-Ray to monitor and troubleshoot your Lambda function.

Set up continuous monitoring and alerting for your Lambda function. You can use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance and availability of your Lambda function.

Finally, make sure to follow best practices for security and compliance when deploying Lambda functions, such as using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to resources, and enabling AWS CloudTrail to monitor API activity.
